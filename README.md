## Colab 0
##CoLab 0: Course Prep and Tutorials
 
###Overview
Colab 0 will not be graded, so you don't need to hand in this notebook. That said, we highly recommend that you work through this notebook, so you can get familiar with the basic concepts of graph mining and Graph Neural Networks.

In this Colab, we will introduce two packages, NetworkX and PyTorch Geometric.

For the PyTorch Geometric section, you don't need to understand all of the details yet. Concepts and implementations of graph neural network will be covered in future lectures and Colabs.
