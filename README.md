### CoLab 0: Course Prep and Tutorials
 
### Overview
Colab 0 will not be graded, so you don't need to hand in this notebook. That said, we highly recommend that you work through this notebook, so you can get familiar with the basic concepts of graph mining and Graph Neural Networks.

In this Colab, we will introduce two packages, NetworkX and PyTorch Geometric.

For the PyTorch Geometric section, you don't need to understand all of the details yet. Concepts and implementations of graph neural network will be covered in future lectures and Colabs.

## Colab 1

### CoLab 1: Learning Node Embeddings
Due: February 13 (On-time) or February 18 (Late)
 
### Overview
In this Colab you will write a pipeline for learning node embeddings over a classic graph in network science, the the Karate Club Network. You will:

Explore multiple graph statistics for this graph.
Then transform the graph structure into a PyTorch tensor, so that you can perform machine learning over the graph.
Finish implementing your first graph learning algorithm: a node embedding model.
